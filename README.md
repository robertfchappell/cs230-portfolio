Summary of the Client and Requirements:
The client, The Gaming Room, wanted a cross-platform game called Draw It or Lose It, which could run on multiple operating systems like Android, iOS, Windows, and web browsers. They needed a design that could ensure consistency across platforms, with shared game logic and minimal platform-specific code.

What I Did Well:
I organized the documentation clearly and outlined the system architecture, major classes, and design patterns that would be used. I communicated technical ideas in a way that would make sense to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Helpful Parts of Working Through the Design Document:
Planning out the design before coding made it much easier to understand how different parts of the software would interact. It helped me spot potential issues early and think through better solutions.

What I Would Revise:
If I could revise one part, I would create even more detailed UML diagrams to make the architecture easier to visualize. Adding more examples and scenarios would have strengthened the documentation.

Interpreting the User’s Needs:
I focused on keeping the design lightweight, scalable, and cross-platform friendly, which aligned with the client’s need for a unified game experience. Considering the user's needs early ensures the final product actually solves the problems it’s meant to, instead of becoming overly complicated or disconnected from real-world use.

Approach to Designing Software:
I started by analyzing the client's problem, breaking it into smaller pieces, and applying object-oriented design principles. In the future, I would use more iterative refinement: starting with rough drafts and improving them step-by-step while gathering feedback.
